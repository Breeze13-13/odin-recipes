    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is no ordinary cookie. </p>
    <p>his is a cookie that is sinfully decadent, and makes no apology for it.</p>
    <p>I feel like the photos tell you everything you need to know to do a run to the grocery shop so you can make these immediatelyâ€¦</p>
    <p>But just in case youâ€™re one of those sensible people who thinks before they act (what is life like that, I wonder? ðŸ¤”), this is what youâ€™re in for: a soft baked, buttery chocolate chip cookie with beautiful caramel undertones thatâ€™s chewy on the inside and just the right amount of crispiness on the edges.</p>
    <p>Oh, and itâ€™s stuffed with Nutella. In case you missed that part!!</p>
    <p>I love how it looks so innocent when you pull it out of the oven. Just another chocolate chip cookieâ€¦</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Filling:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>200g Nutella</li>
            <li>90g dark chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cookie Dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>200g plain flour</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp cooking salt</li>
            <li>120g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>140g brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp honey</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Cookie Dough:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix dry â€“ Mix the flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Barely melt butter â€“ Using a heatproof bowl, microwave the butter for 30 seconds on high until mostly but not fully melted, then stir with a rubber spatula to finish melting it so it's "milky" rather than clear yellow oil (Note 5).</li>
            <li>Wet mixture â€“ Add the sugar, vanilla and honey, stir until combined. Add the egg and stir until combined, it should look like caramel.</li>
            <li>Chill dough 1 1/2 hours â€“ Add the flour mixture and stir until combined. The mixture should be slightly warm and too soft to roll into balls. Cover and refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours to cool and firm up enough to roll into a log.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Frozen Nutella Moulds:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a small tray with baking paper / parchment paper. Dollop Nutella on tray and spread to ~8mm/ 1/3"thick rounds. Freeze for 1 hour until firm enough to pick up.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Stuffing and Baking:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/350Â°F (160Â°C fan-forced). Lightly grease 2 trays then line with paper.</li>
            <li>Cut dough â€“ Scrape dough out and shape/roll into a ~18cm / 7" log. Cut into 10 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Stuff â€“ Flatten cookie dough, press in frozen Nutella, bundle dough up around it to enclose and seal. Flip upside down so the smooth side is facing up. Shape into ~1.5cm/ 3/5" thick rounds, press choc chips into the surface and sides. Repeat to make 10 cookies, 5 on each tray, 8cm/3" apart to allow for spreading (Note 6 working tips).</li>
            <li>Bake both trays at the same time for 12 â€“ 13 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden, the centre is pale golden and just set (ie not raw melty dough).</li>
            <li>Cool & swoon â€“ Remove from the oven and leave on the tray for 10 minutes (finish cooking / set). Transfer to a rack, cool for at least another 5 minutes. Grab, bite, swoon. That moment when the melty Nutella floods into your mouthâ€¦..</li>
